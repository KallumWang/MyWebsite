        <h1>RUINS</h1>
        <p>The Ruins start with you waking up—you have fallen down. In the Genocide Route, the protagonist begins by systematically clearing the Ruins, the tutorial section of the Underground. Rather than sparing monsters, you hunt down every random encounter—including common enemies like Froggits and Vegetoids (note that the first Froggit does not count). Once all enemies are defeated, battles show “But nobody came.” Toriel is defeated in one hit, Napstablook flees, and the world begins to feel... off.</p>

<!-- Section 2: SNOWDIN (Text left, image right) -->
<section class="two-column">
    <div class="info">
        <h1>SNOWDIN</h1>
        <p>In Snowdin, the Genocide path intensifies. You continue killing all monsters to fill the area’s counter. Once it’s complete, the peaceful theme changes to a haunting track. Friendly characters like Sans begin showing concern. Papyrus, usually comedic, tries to stop you—only to be killed in one blow. Townspeople vanish, shops close, and the snowy setting becomes eerily empty, reinforcing your descent into darkness.</p>

        <h1>WATERFALL</h1>
        <p>Waterfall deepens the emotional weight of your actions. Characters who once offered kindness disappear or act afraid. You confront Undyne, who tries to stop you as a true hero—but in the Genocide Route, you fight her powerful transformation, Undyne the Undying. The game increasingly distorts music, visuals, and tone, showing how the world is unraveling as you continue your path of destruction.</p>

<!-- Section 4: HOTLAND (Text left, image right) -->
<section class="two-column">
    <div class="info">
        <h1>HOTLAND</h1>
        <p>In Hotland, the atmosphere grows even darker. You arrive at Alphys's lab only to find it eerily deserted, a sign that everyone has abandoned hope. The puzzles and machines here feel more mechanical and cold, reflecting the detachment caused by your ruthless actions. As you proceed, you encounter Mettaton, who tries to stop you with a final show of defiance. In the Genocide Route, even Mettaton is defeated swiftly, leaving the lab silent and lifeless. The music and visuals continue to distort, reinforcing the crushing emptiness left behind in your wake.</p>

    <div class="info">
        <h1>JUDGMENT HALL</h1>
        <p>The Judgment Hall marks the quiet climax of your Genocide run. With the world nearly emptied, you walk into a golden corridor where Sans—normally laid-back—finally confronts you. His dialogue is heavier than any fight: a blend of philosophy, grief, and guilt. This is where he judges your actions, though he already knows there’s no redemption left. If you’ve killed everyone, he fights back with full force in one of the hardest battles in the game. The Judgment Hall is silent, stripped of music until the fight begins—symbolizing the stillness before a final reckoning. Sans fights not to win, but to stop you, if only for a moment.</p>
