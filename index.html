    <!-- Section 1: RUINS -->
    <section class="two-column">
        <div class="image">
            <h2 class="image-heading">RUINS</h2>

            <h1>Ruins</h1>
            <p>The Ruins start with you waking up—you have fallen down. In the Genocide Route, the protagonist begins by systematically clearing the Ruins, the tutorial section of the Underground. Rather than sparing monsters, you hunt down every random encounter—including common enemies like Froggits and Vegetoids (note that the first Froggit does not count). Once all enemies are defeated, battles show “But nobody came.” Toriel is defeated in one hit, Napstablook flees, and the world begins to feel... off.</p>

    <!-- Section 2: SNOWDIN -->
    <section class="two-column">
        <div class="image">
            <h2 class="image-heading">SNOWDIN</h2>
            <img src="./my pictures/snowdin.png" alt="Snowdin" class="center-ruins">
        </div>
        <div class="info">
            <h1>Snowdin</h1>
            <p>In Snowdin, the Genocide path intensifies. You continue killing all monsters to fill the area’s counter. Once it’s complete, the peaceful theme changes to a haunting track. Friendly characters like Sans begin showing concern. Papyrus, usually comedic, tries to stop you—only to be killed in one blow. Townspeople vanish, shops close, and the snowy setting becomes eerily empty, reinforcing your descent into darkness.</p>

    <!-- Section 3: WATERFALL -->
    <section class="two-column">
        <div class="image">
            <h2 class="image-heading">WATERFALL</h2>
            <img src="./my pictures/waterfall.png" alt="Waterfall" class="center-ruins">
        </div>
        <div class="info">
            <h1>Waterfall</h1>
            <p>Waterfall deepens the emotional weight of your actions. Characters who once offered kindness disappear or act afraid. You confront Undyne, who tries to stop you as a true hero—but in the Genocide Route, you fight her powerful transformation, Undyne the Undying. The game increasingly distorts music, visuals, and tone, showing how the world is unraveling as you continue your path of destruction.</p>
