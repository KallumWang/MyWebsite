            <h1>Ruins</h1>
            <p>The ruins start with you waking up you have fallen down. 
                In the Genocide Route, the protagonist begins by systematically clearing the Ruins, the tutorial section of the Underground. In this route, rather than sparing monsters, the player hunts down every random encounter—including common enemies like Froggits, and Vegetoids note that the first Froggit does not count towards the enemy counter.
                Once the kill counter in the Ruins is fully exhausted, battles still trigger but display “But nobody came,” signaling that no further monsters remain in that area.
                At that point, the typical peaceful “Determination” message at each SAVE Point is replaced with a static kill counter, though numbers only appear in later regions.
                In the Ruins itself, you’ll know genocide is underway when Napstablook runs away from you and Toriel is defeated in one hit (she acts as the area boss).
                After this point, the ambient music slows and warps, and the game world subtly shifts—puzzles may be pre‑solved, and many NPCs disappear or alter their script—setting the tone for the darker path ahead.</p>
